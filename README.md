# terratutorial
Welcome!

This repository contains all material associated with the terra tutorial taught on Nov 6, 2024 to staff and postgraduates at the Marine and Freshwater Research Centre (MFRC)
at the Atlantic Technological University (ATU). The tutorial provides an introduction on how to read, manipulate and extract data from spatiotemporal rasters within the R package **terra**.

*Uploaded material includes*:
- lecture slides
- example R code
- R vignette for standard raster processing
- Additional online resources for geostastical operations and R programming

If there are any issues with opening the files, feel free to contact me through this repository or per email (only shared MFRC-internally).

I hope this repository is helpful resource to anyone starting on raster programming in R.
