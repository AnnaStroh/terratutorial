# terratutorial
Welcome!

This repository contains material and a general workflow to work with raster data in R, demonstrated using the R package **terra**. All files in this repo are associated with workshops taught by Anna Stroh, showing how to read, manipulate and extract data from spatiotemporal rasters within the R package **terra**.

The first iteration of the workshop was a tutorial taught on Nov 6, 2024 to staff and postgraduates at the Marine and Freshwater Research Centre (MFRC) at the Atlantic Technological University (ATU). 
Lecture slides introducing the spatiotemporal rasters and the terra package as well as code for that workshop are in the *ATU* folder.

The second iteration of the workshop was taught to staff of the Marine Institute Ireland on Jan 30, 2025. Its workshop files can be found in the folder *MI*. 
*Files in MI*:
- lecture slides
- example R code
- R vignette for standard raster processing
- Additional online resources for geostastical operations and R programming

If there are any issues with opening the files, feel free to contact me through this repository or per email (only shared MFRC-internally).

I hope this repository is helpful resource to anyone starting on raster programming in R. 

Anna
